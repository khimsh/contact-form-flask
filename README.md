# Flask Contact Form

This is a simple contact form using python and Flask framework.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repo.

   `$ git clone`

2. Activate virtual environment. I'm using pipenv as the virtualenv so it's as simple as running:

   `$ pipenv shell`

3. Install requirements.

   `$ pipenv install`

   In case you're not using pipenv, requirements.txt is also provided, so you can run:

   `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. If you wish to run the app in development/debug mode you can do so from the terminal:

   For windows:

   `$ export FLASK_ENV=development`

   For mac/linux (I think):

   `$ set FLASK_ENV=development`

5. Run the app:

   `$ flask run`
